        This website documents my work term experience as a backend developer working on a digital wallet platform
        in the FinTech space. It outlines the responsibilities I held, the skills I developed, and the growth I
        experienced during my first professional work term.

    <!-- EMPLOYER -->

      <h2>Information About the Employer</h2>

      <p>
        ShamadhanPay is a digital payment platform operated by Samadhan Services Limited, a subsidiary of Grameen
        Telecom. The organization is a licensed Payment Service Provider regulated by Bangladesh Bank and is based
        in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform provides an e-wallet system that supports peer to peer transfers, bill and utility payments,
        merchant payments, and digital user onboarding. From a technical perspective, the company operates within
        the FinTech domain, requiring secure backend systems, reliable transaction processing, and integration with
        multiple external financial institutions.

    <!-- GOALS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <div class="goal">
        <div class="goal-title">Backend API Development for FinTech Systems</div>
        <p>
          I focused on understanding how backend APIs support real transaction processing across multiple external
          banking partners. Through reviewing existing services and contributing to backend improvements, I learned
          how transaction flows are validated, processed, and protected in a financial system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="goal">
        <div class="goal-title">Debugging and Testing in SIT and UAT</div>
        <p>
          A major part of my role involved investigating transaction failures in SIT and UAT environments. I analyzed
          logs, traced issues through backend services, and worked with QA and DevOps to resolve problems. This helped
          me develop a more structured and confident debugging approach.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="goal">
        <div class="goal-title">Communication and Delivery in a Remote Team</div>
        <p>
          Working in a fully remote environment, I focused on clear communication, task organization, and consistent
          delivery. I provided regular updates, tracked work using Jira, and contributed to documentation to support
          collaboration within the team.
        </p>

    <!-- JOB DESCRIPTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Job Description</h2>

      <p>
        During my work term, I worked on the backend of a digital wallet platform, supporting transaction flows and
        investigating issues across different testing environments. Much of my work involved reading existing code,
        debugging failures, and making small but meaningful improvements to backend services.
      </p>

      <p>
        I primarily worked with Python and SQL, used Git for version control, and relied on Jira to manage tasks and
        collaborate with the team. Being part of a growing platform used in Bangladesh was especially motivating,
        as it showed how backend work can contribute to real world impact.
      </p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        This was my first work term, and I began the experience feeling nervous about contributing to real production
        systems. Over time, I gained confidence through hands on backend work, debugging, and collaboration within a
        remote engineering team. By the end of the term, I felt more prepared and excited to continue developing my
        skills as a software developer.

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

      <p>
        I would like to sincerely thank my reporting manager, Moinul Haque, for his guidance, patience, and feedback
        throughout the work term. I am also very grateful to my supervisor and CTO, Rezaul Kabir, for the opportunity
